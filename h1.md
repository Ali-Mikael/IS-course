# Threat modeling (X)

## Threat modeling manifesto 
> Reference: <https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/>


### Threat modeling aims at highlighting security & privacy concerns.
- Anyone with a concern of their systems privacy, safefety & security should do threat modeling.
- The threat modeling manifesto should not be taken as law, but rather as the building blocks for your own methods and structures. It lays a proficient foundation.
- The manifesto follows two simple guidelines:
  - **Values:**
    - Finding & fixing.
    - People & collaboration.
    - Journey of understanding.
    - Doing instead of talking.
    - Continuous refinement.
  - **Principles:**
    - Early & frequent analysis and systematic approach.
    - Outcomes should provide value to stakeholders.
    - Open dialog is key, documenting solidifies.

**To summarize:**
- Threat modeling is a continuous process, that should provide value for stakeholders. 
- No room for lonely wolfs, threat modeling shoul be done with a diverse group of people while maintaining open & constructive communication.
- Methods and solutions should always be systematical & practical.
- *Do*, rather than talk!

### Why we threat model?
- To anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them.


### The four question framework
- What are we working on?
- What can go wrong?
- What are we going to do about it?
- Did we do a good enough job? <br>
By asking these questions, we are in fact, *threat modeling!*

### What are we working on?
- Sketch down what is going on, visualise the situtation.
- Get people involved. Collaborate to get people to answer: what are we working on?
- Develop a **document of record** for process and progress.
  - Not only for bussines and regulatory means, but also to help better understand: what are we working on & what can go wrong?
- **Data flow diagrams**
  - Helping us better understand what we are working on.
  - They contain five elements:
    - **External entities** (out of our control)
    - **Processes** (what happens where)
    - **Data flows** (connecting external entities and processes)
    - **Trust boundaries** (who operates what)


### What can go wrong?
- The qrucial question that should always linger around.
- A great tool for this particular task:
    - **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, DoS, Elevation of privileges)
      - This should server as a fundemental framework for blotting down what could go wrong!


### What are we going to do about it?
- Answering the question: what can go wrong? And then doing something about it, and keeping a record of said actions.
- What are going to do? What not? And what kind of risk management are we going to implement?



### Did we do a good job?
- Would you tell about the threat modeling process to a colleague or a friend?
  - If yes: <br>
    Then you probably did a good enough job!
  - If else: <br>
    You probably have to get back to the drawing board, the job is not done! ;) 






## OWASP: Threat modeling cheat sheet
> Reference: <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html>

**Advantages of threat modeling**
- Identifying risks early on. Allowing systems to have "built-in" security rather than "bolted-on"
- The idea is to identify and mitigate risks before the system even touches production.
- Improved visibility into a system and its interactions.
<br>

The contents of the OWASP threat modeling cheat sheet, is something we have already went through in this post, allthough it talks about some aspects in more detail. This document is a good to have by your side, when first getting into threat modeling, it gives great insight into the world of threat modeling, and really lays the foundation for your threat modeling processes. 10/10 definitively recommend!

# Security hygiene (A)
Some very basic security practises **everyone** should follow:
- Never use the same password twice. (use an offline password manager)
- Use MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) whenever possible.
- Never open links on messages/emails you are not expecting.
  - Matter of fact, never open any links if you don't know what they entail, especially if the website is not trusted/known.
- Always be skeptical when you get a message from an "official" authority asking you to identify yourself or share personal details. Or any authority/organization for that matter.
- Be vigilant, be skeptical and never be afraid to question.
