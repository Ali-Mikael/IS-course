# Threat modeling (X)

## Threat modeling manifesto 
> Reference: <https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/>


### Threat modeling aims at highlighting security & privacy concerns.
- Anyone with a concern of their systems privacy, safefety & security should do threat modeling.
- The threat modeling manifesto should not be taken as law, but rather as the building blocks for your own methods and structures. It lays a proficient foundation.
- The manifesto follows two simple guidelines:
  - **Values:**
    - Finding & fixing.
    - People & collaboration.
    - Journey of understanding.
    - Doing instead of talking.
    - Continuous refinement.
  - **Principles:**
    - Early & frequent analysis and systematic approach.
    - Outcomes should provide value to stakeholders.
    - Open dialog is key, documenting solidifies.

**To summarize:**
- Threat modeling is a continuous process, that should provide value for stakeholders. 
- No room for lonely wolfs, threat modeling shoul be done with a diverse group of people while maintaining open & constructive communication.
- Methods and solutions should always be systematical & practical.
- *Do*, rather than talk!

### Why we threat model?
- To anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them.


### The four question framework
- *What are we working on?*
- *What can go wrong?*
- *What are we going to do about it?*
- *Did we do a good enough job?* <br>

By asking these questions, we are in fact, *threat modeling!*

### What are we working on?
- Sketch down what is going on, visualise the situtation.
- Get people involved. Collaborate to get people to answer: what are we working on?
- Develop a **document of record** for process and progress.
  - Not only for bussines and regulatory means, but also to help better understand: what are we working on & what can go wrong?
- **Data flow diagrams**
  - Helping us better understand what we are working on.
  - They contain five elements:
    - **External entities** (out of our control)
    - **Processes** (what happens where)
    - **Data flows** (connecting external entities and processes)
    - **Trust boundaries** (who operates what)


### What can go wrong?
- The qrucial question that should always linger around.
- A great tool for this particular task:
    - **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, DoS, Elevation of privileges)
      - This should server as a fundemental framework for blotting down what could go wrong!


### What are we going to do about it?
- Answering the question: what can go wrong? And then doing something about it, and keeping a record of said actions.
- What are going to do? What not? And what kind of risk management are we going to implement?



### Did we do a good job?
- Would you tell about the threat modeling process to a colleague or a friend?
  - If yes: <br>
    Then you probably did a good enough job!
  - If else: <br>
    You probably have to get back to the drawing board, the job is not done! ;)

## OWASP: Threat modeling cheat sheet
> Reference: <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html>

**Advantages of threat modeling**
- Identifying risks early on. Allowing systems to have "built-in" security rather than "bolted-on".
- The idea is to identify and mitigate risks before the system even touches production.
- Improved visibility into a system and its interactions.
<br>

The contents of the OWASP threat modeling cheat sheet, is something we have already went through in this post, allthough it talks about some aspects in more detail. This document is a good to have by your side, when first getting into threat modeling, it gives great insight into the world of threat modeling, and really lays the foundation for your threat modeling processes. 10/10 definitively recommend!

# Darknet Diaries (X)
> <https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/6/> <br>

## The Beirut bank job - E6
- This episode tells the story of Jason E. Street, former law enforsement agent, who broke into several banks in Beirut.
- Jason has been working in infosec for the past 20 years. He has done both defending and penetration testing, but his favourite thing, is what he calls "Security awereness engagement"
- A bank in the middle east asked him to do one of these Security awereness engagements, so he flew to beirut for a meeting.
- In that meeting they were discussing the details of the mission, and the management wanted him to demonstrate (if possible) network compromise.
- Jason asked how?
- **The objective**
  - Management decided that getting the userid, password, smartcard, a computer and network access, was sufficient in demonstrating said network compromise. <br>

 ### The mission is on
 - It started with Jason being escorted to the first branch (1/3).
 - Jason did some social engineering, and walked inside the offices with confidence and a purpose. He made it seem like he knew what he was doing, and he was in the right place at the right time, so nobody questioned him.
 - He walks inside the offices in a way, that it seemed like he just came from the managers office. So he then proceeds to walk into an employees cubicle, and explains to her that he's doing some computer related audits, and has to check out the employees computer.
 - He plugs in his rubber duckie, and succesfully gains access to the first computer. Now he basically established his precense inside the company network.
 - He does this to a few employees, and eventually establishes a precense inside the office as well.
 - Later on he manages to gain access to a userid, password and a smart card. He basically got access to everything else except the vault, by way of social engineering.
 - He succesfully managed to accomplish 3/5 of the objective.


### The second branch
- Walks inside the breakroom to get water, stays in long enough, so when he finally comes out, he comes out of the "friendly" zone. Make himself seem legit.
- Without saying anything, he walked to the teller area, unplugged a computer, and walked out with it.
- Objecctive 4/5 completed.
- **The logic:**
  - Nobody suspects a guy to just come up, unplugg a computer, and leave with it, without a legitimate reason, it's purely psychological. It just crazy enough to work.
  - Once again shows you how social engineering is done right. 

### The last branch
- Same tactic as before. Walks inside the office, asks the cleaner lady where he can find the networking closet, and simply walks inside. He took a selfie inside the networking room to show how he succesfully completed 5/5 of the objective.
- Once again he used a psychological factor. Nobody at that place and time, associated the network, to have anything to do with the money that was stored inside the bank. So he could just walk inside impersonating a network technician with ease. 


### Conclusions
- Back at the headquarters, people were in shock, thinking to themselves, how in the world did this guy just compromise three of our branches by himself.
- They ofcourse had proper debriefing afterwards, including all employees, which was part of the security awereness engagement.
- This goes to show, how robbers are not only people dressed in ski masks armed with guns. They come in all shapes and sizes. 

#### The moral of the story
- It's okay (even prefered) to be skeptical and questioning in these type of environments.
- Everytime you come across someone/something new, be a little bit suspicous, be vigilant, don't be afraid to question!

#### Final thoughts
This episode came out in 2017, so I really wonder, what the situation would be today in 2025, when people are much more precautious of data and the sorts. <br> <br> 
I feel like people have been much more educated on these topics, but there's obviously still room for this sort of social engineering. As long as there are people involved, there are liabilities and weaknesses. <br> <br> 
It would be interesting to see, what type of tricks and methods would be used nowadays, especially in Europe, to get the same level of access Jason got in the middle east 10 years ago. <br>
(No shade to the middle east here, but I imagine the GDPR puch pressure on many companies and employees to have a tight grip on information security. The kind of pressure you wouldn't see without it ;) )

# Security hygiene (A)
Some very basic security practises **everyone** should follow:
- Never use the same password twice. (use an offline password manager)
- Use MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) whenever possible.
- Never open links on messages/emails you are not expecting.
  - Matter of fact, never open any links if you don't know what they entail, especially if the website is not trusted/known.
- Always be skeptical when you get a message from an "official" authority asking you to identify yourself or share personal details. Or any authority/organization for that matter.
- Be vigilant, be skeptical and never be afraid to question.

# Boogie man (B)
> Threat modeling for an imaginary company 
> <https://terokarvinen.com/information-security/>

### The company
- Local Finnish tech-company called **Projex**.
- The company provides an advanced cloud-based platform for bussinesses and organizations to create, manage and collaborate large-scale projects.
- The platform integrates PM tools, AI-supported smart analytics and secure communication channels.
- Core features:
  - Workflow automation
  - Secure document management
  - Collabration tools
  - Integration with company systems and tools, as well as third-part integrations.
  - Analytics & insight.

### What are we working on?

**Assets:**
- Customer related data
  - Financial data
  - User authentication data
  - Analytic data
  - Project related data (intellectual property/sensitive plans)
<br>

**What do we have to do to keep getting paid:**
- Provide a secure, functioning & reliable platform to host companies big projects.
<br>

### What can go wrong?
> STRIDE & CIA

**Potential Threats**
- **Data breaches** (*High priority!*)
  - Confidentiality
- **Account takeover** (*High priority!*)
  - Authentication bypass
- **DoS** (*Medium priority*)
  - Availability
- **Supply chain fails** (*Lower priority*)
  - Third party integrations causing vulnerabilities
- **Ransomware attacks** (*Medium priority*)
  - Encrypting customer project data and blackmailing
<br>

If the data is breached, this will likely result in not only loosing a customer, but also giving a bad rep to our company, thus directly affecting revenue & bussiness continuity. <br>


### What are we going to do about it?
> **META** framework (Migitage, Eliminate, Transfer, Accept)

**Mitigate:**
- MFA/Multi-factor authentication for all users.
- RBAC/Role-based access controls to limit sensitive data access.
- Monitor and log all access to detect anomalies.
<br>

**Eliminate**
- Remove unused third-party integrations to limit attack surface.
- Disable user accounts with no activity for x period of time.
<br>

**Transfer**
- Cyber insurance to cover potential attack damage.
- Transfer some security responsibilites to cloud vendors.
<br>

**Accept**
- Minor downtime due to maintenance or other unexpected events (brownouts etc)
- Users reusing weak passwords (after clear warnings) 
<br>


### Did we do a good enough job?
- Doing regular security audits, like third-party penetration testing etc.
- Active incident response plan, updated at regular intervals.
- Continuous threat modeling: reasses at regular intervals, as the platform evolves and gains more traction.
- Customer feedback: Customer feedback is key, listen carefully! This will also give us valuable insight into user interaction with the platform, further uncovering possible threats and entry points.
