# Threat modeling (X)

## Threat modeling manifesto 
> Reference: <https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/>


### Threat modeling aims at highlighting security & privacy concerns.
- Anyone with a concern of their systems privacy, safefety & security should do threat modeling.
- The threat modeling manifesto should not be taken as law, but rather as the building blocks for your own methods and structues. It lays a proficient foundation.
- The manifesto follows two simple guidelines:
  - **Values:**
    - Finding & fixing
    - People & collaboration
    - Journey of understanding
    - Doing instead of talking
    - Continuous refinement
  - **Principles:**
    - Early & frequent analysis / systematic approach
    - Outcomes should provide value to stakeholders
    - Open dialog is key, documenting solidifies.

<br>
To summarize:
- Threat modeling is a continuous path, that should provide value for stakeholders. 
- No room for lonely wolfs, threat modeling shoul be done with a diverse group of people while maintaining open & constructive communication.
- Methods and solutions should always be systematical & practical.
- *Do*, rather than talk!

### Why we threat model?
- To anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them. So in the early stages of production!
<br>
### The four question framework
- What are we working on?
- What could go wrong?
- What are we going to do about it?
- Did we do a good job?
<br>
By asking these questions, we are in fact, *threat modeling!*
<br>

### What are we working on / skethcing
- Sketch down what is going on, visualise the situtation.
- Get more people involved. Collaborate to get people to answer: what are we working on?
<br>

### Record your work
- Develop a document of record.
- Not only for bussines and regulatory reasons, but also to help better understand: what are we working on & what can go wrong?
<br>

### Data flow diagrams
- Helping us understand better what we are working on.
- They contain five elements:
  - **External entities** (out of our control)
  - **Processes** (what happens where)
  - **Data flows** (connecting external entities and processes)
  - **Trust boundaries** (who operates what)
  <br>

### What can go wrong?
  - The qrucial question that should always linger around.
  - Tools:
    - STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, DoS, Elevation of privileges)
      - This should server as a fundemental framwork for asking what could go wrong

<br>

### What are we going to do about it?
- Answering the question: what can go wrong? And then doing something about it, and keeping a record of said actions.
- What are we going to do, what are we not going to do & managing risks

<br>

### Did we do a good job?
- Would you tell about the process & outcomes to a colleague or a friend?
  - If yes: <br>
    Then you probably did a good enough job!
  - If else:
    You probably have to get back to the drawing board, the job is not done! ;)
