# Threat modeling (X)

## Threat modeling manifesto 
> Reference: <https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/>


### Threat modeling aims at highlighting security & privacy concerns.
- Anyone with a concern of their systems privacy, safefety & security should do threat modeling.
- The threat modeling manifesto should not be taken as law, but rather as the building blocks for your own methods and structues. It lays a proficient foundation.
- The manifesto follows two simple guidelines:
  - **Values:**
    - Finding & fixing
    - People & collaboration
    - Journey of understanding
    - Doing instead of talking
    - Continuous refinement
  - **Principles:**
    - Early & frequent analysis / systematic approach
    - Outcomes should provide value to stakeholders
    - Open dialog is key, documenting solidifies.

**To summarize:**
- Threat modeling is a continuous path, that should provide value for stakeholders. 
- No room for lonely wolfs, threat modeling shoul be done with a diverse group of people while maintaining open & constructive communication.
- Methods and solutions should always be systematical & practical.
- *Do*, rather than talk!

### Why we threat model?
- To anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them. So in the early stages of production!


### The four question framework
- What are we working on?
- What could go wrong?
- What are we going to do about it?
- Did we do a good job?
<br>
By asking these questions, we are in fact, *threat modeling!*
<br>

### What are we working on?
- Sketch down what is going on, visualise the situtation.
- Get thoughts down on paper, to get a better understanding of the situation at hand.
- Get people involved. Collaborate to get people to answer: what are we working on?
- Develop a **document of record** for process and progress.
  - Not only for bussines and regulatory means, but also to help better understand: what are we working on & what can go wrong?
- **Data flow diagrams**
  - Helping us better understand what we are working on.
  - They contain five elements:
    - **External entities** (out of our control)
    - **Processes** (what happens where)
    - **Data flows** (connecting external entities and processes)
    - **Trust boundaries** (who operates what)


### What can go wrong?
  - The qrucial question that should always linger around.
  - A great tool for this particular task:
    - STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, DoS, Elevation of privileges)
      - This should server as a fundemental framwork for blotting down what could go wrong!


### What are we going to do about it?
- Answering the question: what can go wrong? And then doing something about it, and keeping a record of said actions.
- What are going to do? What not? And what kind of risk management are we going to implement?



### Did we do a good job?
- Would you tell about the threat modeling process to a colleague or a friend?
  - If yes: <br>
    Then you probably did a good enough job!
  - If else: <br>
    You probably have to get back to the drawing board, the job is not done! ;)
