1. As long as your network traffic isn't being monitored, your browser is up to date and you don't have any misconfigurations, tor works, meaning it's completely anonymous.
2. It's not only for people hiding from the law. Various people use it to protect free speach, privacy,  anonymity and secure communications.
3. Tor is open software and has no backdoors.
4. At the time of writing the article, no one in the US has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay.
5. Tor is easy and simple to use!
6. Tor might be slower than a regular Internet connection, but not as slow as some might think. Developers are working hard to make Tor faster.
7. Tor is some of the strongest anonymity software that exists, however, it's not perfect. Misusage & configurations, as well as outdated software are main reasons for Tor to fail.

## Chapter 2 
**Introduction**
- Tor: The Onion Router browser. Modified from the Firefox browser.
- With modifications, tor hides it's users IP-address, making anonomoys interaction on the internet possible for anyone with an internet connection and said Tor browser.
- While there are other means of hiding you IP-address, Tor's ingenuity stems from it's easy of use and not needing any technical skills to fully operate it. <br>


**History and Intended Use of The onion Router**
- Allthough Tor was initially developed by the US government in 2002, it is not controlled or operated by them present-day. 
- Usage: Unrestricted anonymous internet communication, allowing free speach, accessing of government blocked sites, whistleblowing and security over the internet, to name a few. <br>

**How The Onion router Works**
- Tor routes users Internet traffic through random relays on the internet.
- The data in transit is layered with elliptic curve cryptographty, which is (at the time of writing the chapter) immune to brute-force attacks.
- The data goes through 3 logical steps when passed through different relays.
  - Entry -> Middle -> Exit.
- Every relay uncovers a layer of cryptography, and sends it forward. The last step, from exit relay to destination, being unencrypted.
  - This process is kind of like peeling layers of an onion, hence the name: The **Onion** Router
- Out of the whole path, the exit relays knows only the previous relay. The route being chosen at random, and changed every ~10 minutes, making it almost impossible to track. <br>
