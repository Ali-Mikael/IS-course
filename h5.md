# Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1 (X)

The art of cryptography, is to encrypt a message: turn plaintext into ciphertext, and then decipher the message, turn it back into plaintext at will. 

While providing confidentiality for communicaton, crypthography is also asked for:
- Authentication (confirm the origin).
- Integrity (confirm originality).
- Nonrepudiation (not being able to deny ones actions).


### Algorithms & keys

**What is a cipher?**
- A mathematical functtion A.K.A crypthographic algorithm.
- The engine behind the encrypt/decrypt functions.

**The Key**
- A solution to the problem brought by restricted algorithms.
- Restricted algorithms are hiding the inner workings of the algorithm, and keeping them secret. For obvious reasons, this doesn't scale well, and doesn't work in the long run.
- The key is a value, used for encryption/decryption. (Some algorithms use different keys for the functions)
- The value is picked from a range called: the *keyspace*.
- This is the securing aspect of the algorithm, which also allows for standardization and scalability. The algorithm might be known, but without the key, the message stays locked.

**The key-based Algorithms**
- Two types:
- *Symmetric (private-key)*
  - The both end of the functions, calculate their keys from the correspondig keys.
  - Mostly use a single key for communication.
  - This key has to be agreed upon by both parties, and kept hidden, in order for secure communication to take place.
  - Stream cipher: operate on plaintext single bit (sometimes byte) at a time.
  - Block cipher: operate on plaintext a block of bits at a time (typical block size is 64bits).
- *Asymmetric (public-key)*
  - Compared to it's counterpart, enrypt/decrypt functions are performed using different keys, which cannot reasonably be calculated from each other.
  - The enryption key is called the public-key, as it can be made public.
  - The decryption key is called the private-key, as it has to be kept in private, in order for confidentiality to prevail.
 

**Cryptanalysis**
- The science of decrypting a plain-text message without the decryption key.
- Succesfully performed, cryptanalysis will recover either the plaintext or the key.
- Just an attempt, of previously mentioned actions, is called an *attack*, naturally so.
- The four general types of cryptanalytic atttacks:
  - **Ciphertext-only attack:**
      - By having access to multiple messages, all enrypted using the same algorithm,
        the attacker tries to deduce the content or the enryption key. 
  - **Known-plaintext attack:**
      - Having both the ciphertexts and corresponding plaintexts of messages,
        the adversary tries to deduce the key/keys used for the enryption functions,
        or figuring out an algorithm, which will crack future ciphertexts using the same key/keys. 
  - **Chosen-plaintext attack:**
      - 
  - **Adaptive-chosen-plaintext:**
