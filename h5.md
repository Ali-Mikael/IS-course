# Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1 (X)

The art of cryptography is to encrypt a message: turn plaintext into ciphertext > sen message > decipher the message > turn it back into plaintext at will. 

While providing confidentiality for communicaton, crypthography is also asked for:
- *Authentication* (confirm the origin).
- *Integrity* (confirm originality).
- *Nonrepudiation* (not being able to deny ones actions).


### Algorithms & keys

**What is a cipher?**
- A mathematical functtion A.K.A crypthographic algorithm.
- The engine behind the encrypt/decrypt functions.

**The-key ðŸ”‘ **
- A solution to the problem brought by restricted algorithms.
- Restricted algorithms are hiding the inner workings of the algorithm, and keeping them secret. For obvious reasons, this doesn't      scale well, and doesn't work in the long run.
- The key is a value, used for encryption/decryption. (Some algorithms use different keys for the functions)
- The value is picked from a range called: the *keyspace*.
- This is the securing aspect of the algorithm, which also allows for standardization and scalability.
   The algorithm might be known, but without the key, the message stays encrypted and secure.

**The key-based Algorithms**
- Two types:
- *Symmetric / private-key*
  - The both end of the functions, calculate their keys from the correspondig keys.
  - Mostly use a single key for communication.
  - This key has to be agreed upon by both parties, and kept hidden, in order for secure communication to take place.
  - Stream cipher: operate on plaintext single bit (sometimes byte) at a time.
  - Block cipher: operate on plaintext a block of bits at a time (typical block size is 64bits).
- *Asymmetric / public-key*
  - Compared to it's counterpart, enrypt/decrypt functions are performed using different keys, which cannot reasonably be                calculated from each other.
  - The enryption key is called the public-key, as it can be made public.
  - The decryption key is called the private-key, as it has to be kept in private, in order for confidentiality to prevail.
 

**Cryptanalysis**
- The science of decrypting a plain-text message without the decryption key.
- Succesfully performed, cryptanalysis will recover either the plaintext or the key.
- Just an attempt, of previously mentioned actions, is called an *attack*, naturally so.
- The four general types of cryptanalytic atttacks:
  - **Ciphertext-only attack:**
      - By having access to multiple messages, all enrypted using the same algorithm,
        the attacker tries to deduce the content or the enryption key. 
  - **Known-plaintext attack:**
      - Having both the ciphertexts and corresponding plaintexts of messages,
         the adversary tries to deduce the key/keys used for the enryption functions,
          or figuring out an algorithm, which will crack future ciphertexts using the same key/keys. 
  - **Chosen-plaintext attack:**
      - The same logic as a known-plaintext attack, but the adversary chooses which plaintext blocks to encrypt,
         based on which ones would yield more information about the key/algorithm.
  - **Adaptive-chosen-plaintext:**
    - This again builds upon the last one, but here, the cryptanalyst (attacker) can choose smaller blocks of plaintext
       to be encrypted, and then dynamically change his choises based on previous enryption results.


**Algorithm security**
- A good rule of thumb: Make sure that the cost to brake the algorithm always exceeds the value of the encrypted data. 
- In general, substitution ciphers are poor in protecting the plain-text,
   as a powerfull computer and some frequency analysis can easily uncover the protected messsage.
- *One-time pads:*
  - The perfect enryption scheme -author.
  - Long story short, you take the original massage, and turn **each** letter into randomized letter.
  - These randomized letters, exactly the same length as the plain-text, is called the **key**
  - Now take the original text and the key, then turn each letter into a number (a=1,b=2 etc..).
  - Then add corresponding numbers together, and using modulo 26 turn it back into a letter.
  - Voila, now you have the **encrypted message.**
  - Because the key's letters are randomized, there is no way in breaking the cipher without the key, and there is no frequency          analysis to be done.
  - Things to note: the key has to be truly random, and you can never use the same key sequence again, for the encryption to             actually me impenetrable.


 **The top 3 algorithms**
 - **DES** (Data Encyption Standard)
   - The most common computer encryption algorithm.
   - A block cipher with a 56-bit key. Encrypts data in 64bit blocks.
   - Note: popularity on the decline due to breaches. Consider using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
 - **RSA** (Rivest, SHamir & Adleman (the creators))
   - Most popular public-key algorithm.
 - **DSA** (Digital Signature Algorithm)
   - Public-key algorithm used for digital signatures





# PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - GPG (X)

**Sending secret messages**
- Enryption allows for you to send secret messages, in an untrusted environment.
- Signing protects integrity.
- Public keys establishes trust without physical interaction.


**GPG**
- GNU Privacy Guard
- Used to encrypt and sign messages.
- Establishing trust:
   - Installing the gpg tool happens on linux commang line with $sudo apt install gpg
   - Then we can create a key-pair with the tool using $gpg --gen-key (generate key).
   - The public key can now be shared with people we would like to exchange secured data with.
   - When you want to establish trust with another party, exchange public-keys and make sure they are correct, one way or another.
- Sending an encrypted message:
   - Encrypt the text file you want to send with the recipients public key.
   - Now only the recipient can decrypt the message, because he is the only one with the private/public key-pair.
   - The sengers public-key signature is added into the gpg message, confirming sender, and thus confirming authenticity. 







# SSH (A-B)

The ssh server is already installed on the VM.
I simply activated it with the $ systemctl start ssh command

<img width="1010" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 15 50 02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f9542ae-d9d3-4bde-9711-31610a7e1600" />

**Problem & solution:**
- I had some problems connecting to my VM from the host computer using SSH.
- So i had to edit my firewall settings to allow SSH connections.
  - <img width="994" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 35 33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c70fd42a-ed08-404d-8798-5ec81c0049f8" />
- After it was done, i could connect to the VM from my host machine, but I got the idea of making things more interesting, and fired up my ubuntu server. Where i activated the SSH server once more.
   - <img width="773" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 00 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39036f67-20fb-4efe-9453-60547e77b1e5" />
- Now on my kaliVM I generated an SSH keypair using the $ ssh-keygen command.
- After the keys were generated, i edited the permissions to the private key and .ssh directory
   - <img width="858" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 39 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/376c08ea-3ea7-4778-b27a-f992f2c05d08" />
- Keys were generated, and permissions were in check, i could now copy to public key to my ubuntu server, which i want to connect to using the public-key method.
- **NOTE:**
   - I made a directory called authorized_keys on my "loca" machine where i renamed the key-file to kali.pub so i could easily keep track of it during the configuration process.
   - I deleted the directory afterwards to not cause confusion, as the public-key has to be named authorized_keys inside the .ssh directory, for the connecting method to work. 
   - <img width="1012" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 32 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99febb9f-3da1-49e5-bf38-ed84a426595f" />
- After the key was succesfully copied into the .ssh directory on my "remote" machine, i renamed it to *authorized_keys* inside the .ssh directory. 
- I then opened an SSH connection to my ubuntu server.
   - <img width="979" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 02 02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f597c89-6e87-4698-9972-18a47a9c2870" />
   - <img width="1024" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 02 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b2ca4a3-603c-4408-bfa9-7cac347c047f" />
- I located the sshd config file, and used sudo access to modify it. I then configured access with public keys, and specified the path to it. 
   - <img width="983" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 46 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c706d565-7a2d-4eeb-b69f-3d72927da559" />
   - <img width="1028" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 44 52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb2322c-43eb-44f9-889c-00ba2dd142a1" />
- I wanted to login using only the public-key method, so i disabled password authentication
   - <img width="1028" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 46 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a537f3b-e812-459a-a4f7-cd27413b3cf9" />
- The configurations were done, so i restarted the ssh-server
   - <img width="905" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 49 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5a25dd4-0460-4af4-855d-1e5ad4802319" />
- Now it was time to test if all this hard work had paid off. I disconnected from the remote terminal session and tried to login again only using the public-key
   - <img width="1029" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 17 33 34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45efad9b-cabd-4df1-9654-ddc125ec7374" />
- It worked! I typed in the username and ip address of the remote machine, and it let me in without typing a password. Excellent stuff
