# Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1 (X)

The art of cryptography, is to encrypt a message: turn plaintext into ciphertext, and then decipher the message, turn it back into plaintext at will. 

While providing confidentiality for communicaton, crypthography is also asked for:
- Authentication (confirm the origin).
- Integrity (confirm originality).
- Nonrepudiation (not being able to deny ones actions).


### Algorithms & keys

**What is a cipher?**
- A mathematical functtion A.K.A crypthographic algorithm.
- The engine behind the encrypt/decrypt functions.

**The Key**
- A solution to the problem brought by restricted algorithms.
- Restricted algorithms are hiding the inner workings of the algorithm, and keeping them secret. For obvious reasons, this doesn't      scale well, and doesn't work in the long run.
- The key is a value, used for encryption/decryption. (Some algorithms use different keys for the functions)
- The value is picked from a range called: the *keyspace*.
- This is the securing aspect of the algorithm, which also allows for standardization and scalability.
   The algorithm might be known, but without the key, the message stays locked.

**The key-based Algorithms**
- Two types:
- *Symmetric (private-key)*
  - The both end of the functions, calculate their keys from the correspondig keys.
  - Mostly use a single key for communication.
  - This key has to be agreed upon by both parties, and kept hidden, in order for secure communication to take place.
  - Stream cipher: operate on plaintext single bit (sometimes byte) at a time.
  - Block cipher: operate on plaintext a block of bits at a time (typical block size is 64bits).
- *Asymmetric (public-key)*
  - Compared to it's counterpart, enrypt/decrypt functions are performed using different keys, which cannot reasonably be calculated from each other.
  - The enryption key is called the public-key, as it can be made public.
  - The decryption key is called the private-key, as it has to be kept in private, in order for confidentiality to prevail.
 

**Cryptanalysis**
- The science of decrypting a plain-text message without the decryption key.
- Succesfully performed, cryptanalysis will recover either the plaintext or the key.
- Just an attempt, of previously mentioned actions, is called an *attack*, naturally so.
- The four general types of cryptanalytic atttacks:
  - **Ciphertext-only attack:**
      - By having access to multiple messages, all enrypted using the same algorithm,
        the attacker tries to deduce the content or the enryption key. 
  - **Known-plaintext attack:**
      - Having both the ciphertexts and corresponding plaintexts of messages,
         the adversary tries to deduce the key/keys used for the enryption functions,
          or figuring out an algorithm, which will crack future ciphertexts using the same key/keys. 
  - **Chosen-plaintext attack:**
      - The same logic as a known-plaintext attack, but the adversary chooses which plaintext blocks to encrypt,
         based on which ones would yield more information about the key/algorithm.
  - **Adaptive-chosen-plaintext:**
    - This again builds upon the last one, but here, the cryptanalyst (attacker) can choose smaller blocks of plaintext
       to be encrypted, and then dynamically change his choises based on previous enryption results.


**Algorithm security**
- A good rule of thumb: Make sure that the cost to brake the algorithm always exceeds the value of the encrypted data. 
- In general, substitution ciphers are poor in protecting the plain-text,
   as a powerfull computer and some frequency analysis can easily uncover the protected messsage.
- *One-time pads:*
  - The perfect enryption scheme -author.
  - Long story short, you take the original massage, and turn **each** letter into randomized letter.
  - These randomized letters, exactly the same length as the plain-text, is called the **key**
  - Now take the original text and the key, then turn each letter into a number (a=1,b=2 etc..).
  - Then add corresponding numbers together, and using modulo 26 turn it back into a letter.
  - Voila, now you have the **encrypted message.**
  - Because the key's letters are randomized, there is no way in breaking the cipher without the key, and there is no frequency          analysis to be done.
