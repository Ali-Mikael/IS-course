# Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1 (X)

The art of cryptography is to encrypt a message: turn plaintext into ciphertext > send encrypted message > decipher the message > turn it back into plaintext at will. 

While providing confidentiality for communicaton, crypthography is also asked for:
- *Authentication* (confirm the origin).
- *Integrity* (confirm originality).
- *Nonrepudiation* (not being able to deny ones actions).


### Algorithms & keys

**What is a cipher?**
- A mathematical function A.K.A crypthographic algorithm.
- The mastermind behind the encrypt/decrypt functions.

**The-key** 🔑
- A solution to the problem brought by restricted algorithms.
- Restricted algorithms are hiding the inner workings of the algorithm, and keeping them secret. For obvious reasons, this doesn't scale well, and doesn't work in the long run.
- The key is a value, used for encryption/decryption. (Some algorithms use different keys for the functions)
- The value is picked from a range called: the *keyspace*.
- This is the securing aspect of the algorithm, which also allows for standardization and scalability.
   The algorithm might be known, but without the key, the message stays encrypted and secure.

**The key-based Algorithms**
- Two types:
- *Symmetric / private-key* 🔐
  - The both end of the functions, calculate their keys from the correspondig keys.
  - Mostly use a single key for communication.
  - This key has to be agreed upon by both parties, and kept hidden, in order for secure communication to take place.
  - Stream cipher: operate on plaintext single bit (sometimes byte) at a time.
  - Block cipher: operate on plaintext a block of bits at a time (typical block size is 64bits).
- *Asymmetric / public-key* 🔒
  - Compared to it's counterpart, enrypt/decrypt functions are performed using different keys, which cannot reasonably be calculated from each other.
  - The enryption key is called the public-key, as it can be made public.
  - The decryption key is called the private-key, as it has to be kept in private, in order for confidentiality to prevail.
 

**Cryptanalysis** 🔍
- The science of decrypting a plain-text message without the decryption key.
- Succesfully performed, cryptanalysis will recover either the plaintext or the key.
- Just an attempt, of previously mentioned actions, is called an *attack*, naturally so.
- The four general types of cryptanalytic atttacks:
  - **Ciphertext-only attack:**
      - By having access to multiple messages, all encrypted using the same algorithm,
        the attacker tries to deduce the content or the enryption key. 
  - **Known-plaintext attack:**
      - Having both the ciphertexts and corresponding plaintexts of messages,
         the adversary tries to deduce the key/keys used for the encryption functions,
          or figuring out an algorithm, which will crack future ciphertexts using the same key/keys. 
  - **Chosen-plaintext attack:**
      - The same logic as a known-plaintext attack, but the adversary chooses which plaintext blocks to encrypt,
         based on which ones would yield more information about the key/algorithm.
  - **Adaptive-chosen-plaintext:**
    - This again builds upon the last one, but here, the cryptanalyst (attacker) can choose smaller blocks of plaintext
       to be encrypted, and then dynamically change his choises based on previous results.


**Algorithm security**
- A good rule of thumb in securing data: -Make sure that the cost to brake the algorithm always exceeds the value of the encrypted data-
- In general, bare substitution ciphers are poor in protecting the plain-text,
   as a powerfull computer and some frequency analysis can easily uncover the protected messsage.
- *One-time pads:*
  - The perfect enryption scheme
  - Long story short, you take the original massage, and turn **each** letter into randomized letter.
  - These randomized letters, exactly the same length as the plain-text, is called the **key**
  - Now take the original text and the key, then turn each letter into a number (a=1,b=2 etc..).
  - Then add corresponding numbers together, and using modulo 26 turn it back into a letter.
  - Voila, now you have the **encrypted message.**
  - Because the key's letters are randomized, there is no way in breaking the cipher without the key, and there is no frequency          analysis to be done.
  - Things to note: the key has to be truly random, and you can never use the same key sequence again, for the encryption to             actually me impenetrable.


 **The top 3 algorithms**
 > (Keep in mind: the book was written in 2015)
 - **DES** (Data Encyption Standard)
   - The most common computer encryption algorithm.
   - A block cipher with a 56-bit key. Encrypts data in 64bit blocks.
   - Note: popularity on the decline due to breaches. Consider using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
 - **RSA** (Rivest, SHamir & Adleman (the creators))
   - Most popular public-key algorithm.
 - **DSA** (Digital Signature Algorithm)
   - Public-key algorithm used for digital signatures





# PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - GPG (X)
> <https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/>
> by: Tero Karvinen

**Sending secret messages**
- Enryption allows for you to send secret messages, in an untrusted environment.
- Signing protects integrity.
- Public keys establishes trust without physical interaction.


**GPG**
- GNU Privacy Guard
- Used to encrypt and sign messages.
- Establishing trust:
   - Installing the gpg tool happens on linux commang line with $sudo apt install gpg
   - Then we can create a key-pair with the tool using $gpg --gen-key (generate key).
   - The public key can now be shared with people we would like to exchange secured data with.
   - When you want to establish trust with another party, exchange public-keys and make sure they are correct, one way or another.
- Sending an encrypted message:
   - Encrypt the text file you want to send with the recipients public key.
   - Now only the recipient can decrypt the message, because he is the only one with the private-key.
   - The senders public-key signature is added into the gpg message, confirming sender, and thus confirming authenticity. 







# SSH (A-B) 

The ssh server is already installed on the VM.
I simply activated it with the $ systemctl start ssh command

<img width="1010" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 15 50 02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f9542ae-d9d3-4bde-9711-31610a7e1600" />

**Problem & solution:**
- I had some problems connecting to my VM from the host computer using SSH.
- So i had to edit my firewall settings to allow SSH connections.
  - <img width="994" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 35 33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c70fd42a-ed08-404d-8798-5ec81c0049f8" />
- After it was done, i could connect to the VM from my host machine, but I got the idea of making things more interesting, and fired up my ubuntu server. Where i activated the SSH server once more.
   - <img width="773" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 00 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39036f67-20fb-4efe-9453-60547e77b1e5" />
- Now on my kaliVM I generated an SSH keypair using the $ ssh-keygen command.
- After the keys were generated, i edited the permissions to the private key and .ssh directory
   - <img width="858" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 39 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/376c08ea-3ea7-4778-b27a-f992f2c05d08" />
- Keys were generated, and permissions were in check, i could now copy the public key to my ubuntu server.
- **NOTE:**
   - I made a directory called authorized_keys on my "local" machine where i stored the public-key.
   - I deleted the directory afterwards to not cause confusion. I thought initially that authorized_keys was a directory, not a file...
     - Sidenote: I learned this the *hard way*, as i hought the name could be whatever. But then the authentication didn't work, so i had to do some troubleshooting until i realized that the public-key has to be inside a file *authorized_keys*, not a directory... You live and you learn right?... 😂
   - <img width="1012" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 32 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99febb9f-3da1-49e5-bf38-ed84a426595f" />
- After the key was succesfully copied into the .ssh directory on my "remote" server, I then opened an SSH connection to it.
   - <img width="979" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 02 02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f597c89-6e87-4698-9972-18a47a9c2870" />
   - <img width="1024" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 02 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b2ca4a3-603c-4408-bfa9-7cac347c047f" />
- I located the sshd_config file, and used sudo access to configure pub-key authentication.
   - <img width="983" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 46 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c706d565-7a2d-4eeb-b69f-3d72927da559" />
   - <img width="1028" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 44 52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb2322c-43eb-44f9-889c-00ba2dd142a1" />
- I wanted to login using only the public-key method, so i disabled password authentication
   - <img width="1028" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 46 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a537f3b-e812-459a-a4f7-cd27413b3cf9" />
- The configurations were done, so i restarted the ssh-server
   - <img width="905" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 16 49 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5a25dd4-0460-4af4-855d-1e5ad4802319" />
- Now it was time to test if all this hard work had paid off. I disconnected from the remote terminal session and tried to login again only using the public-key
   - <img width="1029" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 17 33 34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45efad9b-cabd-4df1-9654-ddc125ec7374" />
- It worked! I typed in the username and ip address of the remote machine, and it let me in without typing a password. Excellent stuff



# PGP (C)
Time to generate encryption keys and start sending secret messages. Let's dive right in!

### Getting started
- First i fired up both of my VM's && updated the systems.
- Then it was time to install a few packages (which were already installed except the editor)
   - <img width="533" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 12 26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f55bbf6-73de-477d-85c6-f944759e824b" />
   - <img width="711" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 13 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c18426b-8755-4e6a-b10b-9b965b27d22a" />

### Creating keys
> Using the same logic as creating the ssh keys.
- <img width="1042" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 17 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a4111e0-df1c-4f2d-b5ab-dc5aefcae809" />
- <img width="914" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 23 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0105d1c7-2278-43d4-8262-7c014b237e09" />

### Confirming they we're created
- <img width="1046" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 26 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60c93061-fd5e-4411-b4e8-3f0d2734dfaf" />
- "Output omitted from server side"

### Exporting key and sending it
- Exporting the key into an easily recognisable file and as ascii text.
- <img width="804" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 29 32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfef6217-1d61-4c6b-963e-bb166f893340" />
- Because of earlier ssh public-key configuration, i could easily transport the file to my ubuntu-server using scp
- <img width="1053" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 31 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8b9ac6f-4bb7-4915-82da-bb2dd71f81fa" />
- **Sending server-side pub-key to my kali VM:**
   - <img width="521" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 35 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aeaf3de-8a19-441e-9158-5c61ff12af52" />


### Establishing trust
- It was time to import the key and establish the sender as a trusted entity.
   - <img width="857" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 48 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc3fb445-7575-4692-9fcf-5c953fb0f66b" />
   - **Signing the key**
   - <img width="292" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 49 29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9924d28-89b9-4e76-8596-a393b967f407" />
   - <img width="566" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 12 49 38" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef88cc2-38d8-423e-9a3a-1bea6c246a76" />


### Sending secret messages
- I created a .txt file (content to be revealed). And then encrypted it in the following way
   - <img width="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 13 18 16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35571caa-3361-424e-811e-562f99b6caff" />
- The cipher-text:
   - <img width="842" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 13 19 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30a19814-7a05-4e44-952c-0b3f36dda679" />
- Sending it to server using scp
   - <img width="1012" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 13 20 48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c6cf543-309f-4972-9f17-5acde8913b26" />
   - Got it! >> <img width="574" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 13 21 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88ee3cb5-0d26-4183-9c22-e50765cba8b2" />
- Enrypting the message on my server using **$ pgp --decrypt < filename >**
- It then prompted me the password i set when creating the keys.
- Once I confirmed my password, boom went the dynamite and the encrypted message was revealed =
   - <img width="493" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-23 at 13 24 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69a23c2d-97c0-4bb5-adce-2fda80214ec7" />


### Final thoughts
- This was the perfect step to take after configuring the SSH public-key authentication, as it expanded on how the key-pairs can be used in practise.
- Also got some much needed hands-on practise on configuring and setting up key-pairs for various purposes. 
- **Thinking:** I do wonder how you should protect the private key on your host computer tho, because if an attacker were to gain access to it, the whole system would be rendered useless. Maybe using a yubikey? (something i stumbled upon while doing these exercises). Or maybe even masquerading the file on your computer somehow and putting it behind some setup? Don't know, have to dig a little deeper still. 




# Password manager (D)
After some research, i found out the perfect candidate for my new password manager.

It ticked all the boxes
- free ✔️
- open-source ✔️
- offline ✔️
- And it works perfectly with my macOS, plus i can use it on linux.

The software is so advanced i can't take screenshots from the app 😂😂😂

The next picture is a legit screenshot i took from the GUI:
<img width="882" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 22 49 26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dc2da5b-6908-46f8-bde6-6043f9a70a2b" />

So i'm just going to explain what happened (plz don't remove me from the course Tero, I promise I have it up and running on my laptop!):
- First it took me through the steps to configure a database for the password entries.
- I kept the default settings. The password manager uses AES-256 encryption for the database.
- I created the database, and then set a masterkey, which i commited into memory. I used a very strong password for this.
- Now the database was created on my computer locally.
- <img width="419" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 22 55 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cca892a-2ab1-4bbd-ad7c-f0d390d54ffb" />

**What this means for me**
- Every time I open the database using my manager, i use the masterkey to decrypt it, and get access to all stored passwords.
- This mitigates the risk of all my password being exposed at the same time, due to some big databreach on a big company's servers.
- The bigger the servers, the bigger the target, the bigger the risk of being hacked.
- Big companies have a constant threat of being hacked, if I use third-party servers, all my passwords would be leaked instantly in case of a data breach.
- Now, when using a password manager on my laptop, and storing the database locally, i can keep using unique, strong passwords everywhere, without having to remember them by heart.
   Even if one password was to be leaked in an attack, it's okay, because i don't use the same password anywhere else, and i can just go ahead and change it.
- Okay bet, let's say the hackers were to aquire the database from my computer somehow, well good luck opening it without the masterkey! It's stored locally in my brain, good luck getting it out ;)
- A password manager is a must have in my opinion. You can't keep re-using the same passwords, and you can't store 50 unique passwords all in memory (atleast the majority of us...).
- I've been using one for a few years now, but the only problem is, it's stored in the cloud, sitting on one of the worlds biggest tech-company's servers (i think, they might be using third-parties for all i know 😂). Now I can migrate them away from there, and host them myself. Might even start using a YbiKey in conjuction with the password manager if i feel courageus. 🤷‍♂️
